HTML
1. <br>: it took forever to figure out how to do line breaks I don't know why I didn't just look it up
2. linking to other pages: I didn't initially realize that I had to copy over the same header and footer in order to keep the top and bottom of the site the same 
when I'm clicking to new pages. 
3. favicons: I didn't understand what they were for but a little googling helped me out. It was actually fun to design one for myself

CSS
1. nav bar: although nav is an html element, most of my issue with the nav bar came with styling it properly, but using descendant selector really helped me out
2. nth-child: I used this to make the second column of my table much bigger than the first. I thought I was going to have to colspan everything but this was much easier
3. float: I used to that create a left and right div. that was a pretty cool concept to learn
