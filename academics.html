                <li><a href="https://github.com/amanukyan11/checklist" target="_blank">GREEN AGENDA: A NATURE INSPIRED TO-DO LIST:</a>
                    This is a website that I made as a group project. It's an online checklist with a lot of helpful features, like a pomodoro counter, 
                    a progress bar, and a little tree that grows as tasks get completed.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/hovik16/Brewin-Interpreter" target="_blank">Brewin Interpreter:</a>
                    This is an interpreter created for a custom UCLA themed language called <span style="color: blue;">"Brewin"</span>. It uses a parser 
                    and builds an AST, which then compiles your program and outputs into your terminal. Lexical scoping, dynamic typing, and recursion are 
                    some of the features I built into the interpreter. 
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/404NotFoundJS/CS118-F23-Project-1" target="_blank">Simple HTTP Server:</a>
                    This is a simple http server I made as a paired programming project that operates on the application layer. It handles HTTP requests and responses, 
                    and acts as a reverse proxy to a famous Rick Astley video. 
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/404NotFoundJS/CS118-F23-Project-2" target="_blank">TCP Replica:</a>
                    This is a TCP replica that I made as a paired programming project that operates on the transport layer. It incorporates all important TCP features, 
                    such as losslessness, reliability, and flow control. 
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/hovik16/Dune_Worm_Animation" target="_blank">Dune Worm Animation:</a>
                    This is a simple animation I made as a paired programming project. It's a simple animation of a Sandworm from Dune that oscillates through the desert. 
                    The animation was created using a custom library called tiny-graphics that is used at UCLA. 
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/hovik16/BlackJack" target="_blank">Blackjack Game:</a>
                    This is a terminal based Blackjack game I created. Spending money at casinos is rabbit hole, and online gambling is no better, so I created something
                    that will scratch my Blackjack itch without risking my bank account
