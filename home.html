            <p>
                Thank you for visiting my web site! This page is here to help you get to know me a little better. 
            </p>

                I am a hard working student looking for an opportunity to collaborate and gain experience by utilizing my dependability, attention to detail, and efficient 
                organizational skills, and am motived to learn, grow, and excel in software development.             
            </p>

            <p>
                I’ve been interested in programming ever since I was a little kid. As a child, I watched an old 80s movie called “War Games” that introduced me to the field and 
                sparked a passion in me that has been growing ever since. I’ve been increasing my knowledge base and working on my skills ever since high school and I’ve 
                been loving every second of it, even though real programming is nothing like an old 80s movie.

                The first game I ever made was a very simple clicker game for my high school coding class’ final project. Building something from scratch and watching it work 
                in real time gave me a sense of accomplishment that has defined the rest of my academic development. While my portfolio may not boast the highest quantity 
                of projects, I believe the quality and diversity of my experiences, coupled with my academic background at UCLA, demonstrate the depth and wide-ranging nature 
                of my knowledge. I am a very quick learner, a great team player, and an incredibly hard worker
